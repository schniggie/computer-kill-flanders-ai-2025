Okay, ladies,
let's all take out this month's book,
then open it, close it
- and break out the wine.
-
[UNCERTAIN NOISES]
You're supposed to say "Woo." [CHUCKLES]
Luann, we're not feeling very "woo."
What we're feeling is woo-ried.
- Mm-hmm.
- This is an intervention.
I don't have a problem with drinking.
It's not the wine.
Luann, you have
an addiction to wine merch.
-
- [SIGHS] And we say this out of love,
it's super annoying.
[MURMURING AGREEMENT]
But it's such a fun way of
telling the world I like wine.
"Mom Fuel,"
that "corks are for quitters."
"Wine is the answer,
what was the question?" [LAUGHS]
The question is do you want
to live your life like this?
Oh! And I suppose all your
throw pillows just say nothing.
Anyway,
it's not like it's hurting anyone.
Isn't it?
I'm the closing manager at Mom Goods.
I was injured when you got into
a fight with another customer
over an apron that says
"This is my wine bib."
[ASHAMED GROAN]
Luann, we're here for you.
B-But being a funny
wine mom is my thing.
I have absolutely
nothing else in my life.
- [CRYING]

You like coffee, right?
What if your new personality was coffee?
Coffee merch doesn't get me there.
Chocolate?
"It's chocolate o'clock somewhere"?
That makes no sense, Bernice.
How about "proud slut"?
Hmm
mm
I love it!
And here is your very first merch.

Goodbye, Malibu Stacy.
Good luck, Malibu Stacy.
Miss you already.
Goodbye, all you think piece-

And you're not here for me.
Hi, Shauna!
Um, who are you, freak?
Besides a freaky freak, you freak.
I'm Malibu Stacy, your Malibu Stacy.
I came here from Malibu Stacy Land
because a real girl who
plays with me needs my help.
And that's you, Shauna.
You still play with dolls?
[SCOFFS] No.
It's okay to be complicated.
As women, we can encompass multitudes.
Encompass my fist!
[STACY SCREAMS]
- [GRUNTS]
- Yeah, get her!
Get out of here
and leave me alone, loser.
I'm so sorry.
Meet me at home after school.
We'll have a tea party.
I love you so much.
[GRUNTS] You're not fighting me.
You're fighting your
fears of growing up.

[YAWNING]
All right, good night, Nelly.
Mama, could you tell me a story?
How about one from the
Kingdom of the Classy Ladies?
[CHUCKLING] Another one?
Ah, please,
I never get tired of their adventures.
Well, once upon a time,
there was a beautiful princess
named Muntzeena.
Oh, and she loved to dance
with all of her friends
atop the glittery stage of
[NELSON] Lord Tracksuit's Manor!
[MRS. MUNTZ] One fine eve,
a party of knights of
the Order of the Bachelor
from the Valley of Silicon were there,
tossing much gold.
Did they bring a wizard with them
who could control the weather?
Oh, they sure did.
And boy, oh, boy, did he make it rain.
But treachery was in the air.
As the evil Princess Rylee with two Es
stepped onto the stage,
bidding the troubadour play
"Poureth Some Sugar Unto Me."
But that's Princess
Muntzeena's frolicking ditty.
- Rylee stole it!
- Indeed.
And filled with righteous fury,
Muntzeena removed her
magical Lucite heel
and chucked it at Rylee's stupid face.
Oh, Princess Muntzeena didn't get
docked two weeks' pay again, did she?
No. Because the keeper of the door,
Sir Gordo of the Latin Kings,
is fair and wise
and kind of into older broads.
So he banished Princess Rylee
to the shift of the morn,
when all the princes are sleeping off
last night's potions.
[NELSON] Then King Nelson came in,
stole all the ducats
and treated Muntzeena
to lunch at Krusty Burger.
Oh, my hero.
No, Mom, you're mine.
Ah, shut up.
[BOTH GRUNT AFFECTIONATELY]
Fun fact about Jennifer Garner, Marge:
She'll take a night
at home with the kids
over a Hollywood premiere
any day of the week.
I told you that!
Oh, I forgot the tampons.
Can you go grab a box?
Shh, the checkout stranger can hear.
They don't care what you buy.
Just get the tampons. We're in a hurry.
That's a happy graduation card.
Oh, it's not those things?
I guess I'm bad at shopping.
So you'll have to go get those things.

Stop right there, Marge.

'Cause I don't!
Experts say the cigarette

before shelves are restocked

Mm. I hope we have enough smokes
to last until this is over.
I'm sure we'll be okay

All hail! Our queen has returned!
Woodland friends, it is good to see you.
How has the kingdom fared in my absence?
The realm is troubled, milady,
and your wisdom is much required.
By royal decree, we command
that the roads of our
kingdom be improved
so that all may benefit.
Whoa, who's gonna pay for that?
Oh hmm.
Ooh, what about this?
For every spell cast,
we impose a tariff of one gold piece.
You're aware that that unfairly
targets witches, right?
This is why so many of us
are moving to other kingdoms.
Well, you want better roads, right?
And affordable housing?
So you can live closer to work?
Yes, give it to us now.
So, the money for all that
has to come from somewhere.
That's the kingdom's job.
What about a property tax on moats?
Oh, yeah, soak the rich.
That's your answer to everything.
Calm down, my good people.

Janice passed away six months ago,
and I'm finally ready to open my heart

We were at war for 50 years.
Oh, God, what a nemesis she was.

you ever met.
May she burn in Hell.

- Anyway, ever since I spit on her ugly grave,

I'm looking for someone
in my rage bracket.
I'm not young.
I don't have time to waste
exchanging passive-aggressive emails,
or shooting hostile stares
across a supermarket.
I'm looking for a real commitment.
If you think that could be you,
reach out.
I just want to make someone miserable
for the rest of their worthless life.
