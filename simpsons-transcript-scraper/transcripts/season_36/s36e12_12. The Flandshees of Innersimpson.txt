[MARGE] Hmm.
Who are these perfectly
coiffed young men
on all the billboards?
Wolfgang Von Bassdrop?
Pound Sign Von Pound Sign?
Sex Towel?
Glenn the Eruptor?
[SCOFFS] In my day,
billboards advertised
things that made sense,
like energy drinks or exciting
new windshield repair companies.
Now it's just an endless
stream of lookalike weirdos
who no one has ever heard of.
They're all DJs with residencies
at casinos and nightclubs.
They can make millions
of dollars in one night.
I heard DJ Cheeseface bought
his parents a mansion.
That's right, Homer.
He bought us a mansion.
Son buy mansion?
Bart is son.

What the hell are you doing?
Duh, I'm giving you a glow-up
for your rewarding new career.
Keeping you off the streets
and me in a mansion.
You're going to be the
world's next hot DJ.
You can start by mixing
with all my old records.
Smash Mouth,
British nerd rocker Thomas Dolby.
Akron, Ohio nerd rockers Devo.
And Taco's Puttin' On the Ritz.
Mmm, tacos, pudding and Ritz.
From these musical seeds, you will grow
a mighty skyscraper of
DJ fame and fortune.
Now get behind those turntables
and start spinning that
big stack of black shellac.

What's all this ruckus?
It's the middle of the night.
If the boy's gonna
succeed in the DJ world,
he needs to practice on Ibiza time,
though at this point, I don't even think
he's good enough for Corfu.
I don't know what any

Seems like a good investment to me.
I don't have a single concern.

Bart I mean Bartholomieux.
When are you planning to drop the beat?
Apparently, it's very important.
Evening, Homer, or should I say morning?
Listen, you know I like
to keep my blankets dry
and my parties unpooped,
but, uh, all this, well,
noise, I guess you'd call it,
is making it difficult for
me and my boys to sleep.
It's not noise.
It's a tantalizing journey into sound.
Well, could you at least ask
Bart to turn it diddly down?
What?!

inconvenienced by Bart's
musical endeavors,
it's, uh,
really up to me to find a solution.
So I went out and purchased
three pairs of these good boys.
Noice-canceling headphones, eh?
Man, I've always wanted to try those.
Mind if I take them out for a test spin?
Well, actually, I
Thanks, neighbor.

Bart, what happened?
The beat, I waited too long to drop it.
It was like a tiger in a cage,
and I just kept taunting it.
[CRYING]
Yates was right: "Things fall apart.
The center cannot hold."
And when he wrote that in 1918,
they didn't even have DJs.
I'm sorry, Dad,
but I'm out of the DJ game.
But what about my mansion?
I've already started
interviewing butlers.
I used to think DJs
were overpaid frauds,
but I now know they require
the nerves of a surgeon
and the rare gift of turning music
into faster, louder music.
If anything, they aren't paid enough.
Sorry, guys.
You can all go home.
- Right, very good, sir.
- As you wish, sir.
It's been an honor, sir.
I'm just glad we were able to
sleep through your big explode-o
thanks to those noise-canceling
headphones your father bought.
Oh, actually, I didn't buy them.
I-I kind of borrowed them from Flanders.
So Ned and his boys
had to spend the night
enduring that no offense, Bart
racket?!
Homer Simpson,
you return those headphones
and apologize immediately.
Fine. [SCOFFS]
The things I do for this family.
Oh, hey, Flanders.
I was just bringing back
your headphones.
Oh, you don't look so good.
Did you get beat up at the circus?
Homer, this sweater is the one thing
you've never, ever borrowed from me.
So I'm giving it to you now.
[HEADPHONES CLATTER]
Hmm. Hmm-hmm.
Ah, it's a little small.
Now that I've literally given
you the shirt off my back,
you and I will never have any
reason to interact ever again.
In fact, these are the last
words I'll ever say to you.
Oh, I've never seen Ned that upset.
Ned Flanders is never
going to speak to me again?
Ever? I guess I only have two words.
Woo-hoo!
[THUNDER CRASHES]
The dark times have begun.
Some days I wish Mrs.
McCormick had never moved here.
♪
So, Flanders thinks he'll never speak
another word to me again, eh?
Well, I say woo-hoo.
Have I said woo-hoo yet?
You have, Homer.
Well, it bears repeating.
I mean, does he think
I enjoy talking to him?
Because I don't.
[MARGE GROANS]
You're right, if anything,
it should be me that never
says another word to him.
In fact, do you know
who the real victim is?
Is it you?
Bingo.
However, if Flanders thinks
that by not talking to me,
he [LAUGHS] wins,
I cannot allow that to happen.
By this time tomorrow,
he'll be talking my ear off.
Great plan.
[HOMER] It is a great plan,
and I'll tell you why.
I'm asleep, aren't I?
Yes.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Listen up, Flanders, we need to talk
about this so-called
"vow of silence" of yours.
You go first.
[WHIMPERS]
I've never seen my
daddy so angry before.
It's like a bad movie.
Have you ever seen a movie, Todd?
No. What happens?
- A lot of stuff.
- Neat!
Oh, my dad has done so many
bad things to your dad,
and I think your dad
has finally had enough.
I really don't think
this is gonna blow over.
- [LEAF BLOWER BUZZING]
- [HOMER] Oh, my God.
Look what's blowing over.
Leaves from my tree.
And they're going into Flanders' yard.
Neighbors fight over this
kind of thing all the time,
so I bet you have something
to say to me about it.
Oh, come on, Flanders.
Yell or something.
Put me in my place.

[GROANING]
Should we help your dad or
wait till he stops twitching?

Hiya, Marge.
To what do I owe my guest appearance

Actually, Ned,
I was wondering if you and I could maybe
discuss this situation
between you and Homer.
Of course we could.
Come on in.

[NO AUDIO]
[HOMER WHIMPERING]
So? So? Did he talk about me?
He sure did.
[SIGHS] I got to say, Homer,
if I weren't married to you,
I probably wouldn't talk to you, either.
Oh, I can't take this anymore.
I thought Flanders not talking to me
would be a magical Mardi Gras,
but instead it's been
a never-ending Lent.
[CRYING]
Lent!
Then why not do the one
thing you haven't done?
Apologize.
That's it.
I'll write him an apology.
♪
Hmm, mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Actually, Dad, it's good.
Really good.
I had no idea you had such
depths of feeling in you.
I mean, wow.
You did quote the movie Point Break
more than I expected, but I really think
Mr. Flanders may finally forgive you.
I hope you're right.
I bared my whole soul in this letter,

Writers must be the happiest

It's my stuff, you imbecile.
I'm reclaiming everything
you've ever borrowed from me
and destroying it so you
can never borrow it again.
That includes the lock
on your front door.
But what about my apology?
Homer, your apology was beautiful,
heartfelt and enraging!
Huh?
You know,
I gave you a pass all these years
'cause I thought you were
just too dumb to know better,
but this eloquent plea for forgiveness
shows you're a thinking,
feeling human being,
and you did that stuff to me anyway!

world I truly love.

I have never seen two people

Instead of jail,
I sentence the two of you

All right,
that does it for talk therapy.
Luckily, there are drugs.
- I don't do drugs.

There have been amazing
advances in the use
of therapeutic psychedelics
for dysfunctional couples.
U-completamine will take
you on a shared journey

with only a slight risk of
permanent brain explosion,

I see how happy and successful you are,

I treat you terribly out

Also because you've got awesome
stuff and I like taking it.
And I wish I could savor
life half as much as you do.
But what I truly love is
feeling morally superior to you.
That's why I accept and even
encourage your worst behavior.
