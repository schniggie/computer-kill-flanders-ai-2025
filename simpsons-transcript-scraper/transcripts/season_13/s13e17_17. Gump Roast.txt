(ALL GASPING) What are you doing here? Our planet has been observing your puny species since your planet was created 5,000 years ago by God.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
And now humanity must be judged! The fate of your planet rests on one human being, Homer Simpson! Why him? Because he is the fat, selfish epitome of modern man! Hey, he stole my bit! Now we shall probe you to see if you are worthy.

Why you little (GRUNTING) DOCTOR: Better or worse? HOMER: Worse! DOCTOR: Better or worse? HOMER: Much better! Lisa, no! Your hands are too weak! Ow! (BOTH PANTING) I'll mace you good! (SCREAMING) Your species is brutish and primitive! Do you have anything to say before we obliterate your planet? Wait! What about Maggie's memories? Surely the innocent soul of a child will redeem mankind! (LAUGHING) Sure, let's give it a shot.
Oh, there's my sweet little Maggie.

You're a Simpson again.
(BURPING) You know, Maggie.
The sooner kids talk, the sooner they talk back.
I hope you never say a word.
Daddy.
(SOBBING) It worked, Mom! Maggie's memories have shown them humanity's inner goodness! These are not tears! We are vomiting from our eyes! Your baby's treacle has only intensified our loathing! Wait! Look at the screen! The baby continues to reminisce.
