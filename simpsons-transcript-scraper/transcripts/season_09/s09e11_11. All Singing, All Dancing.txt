Who knew that Lee Marvin could do such marvelous splits? He's dreamy.
Oh, why did they have to screw up a perfectly serviceable wagon story - with all that fruity singing? - I thought it was toe-tappir fun.
Singing is the lowest form of communication.
Homer, you sing all the time.
No, I don't.
I hate to rhyme.

It's more of a Shelbyville idea.
Now wait just a minute.
We're twice as smart as the people of Shelbyville.
Just tell us your idea, and we'll vote for it.
All right.
I tell you what I'll do.
I'll show you my idea.
